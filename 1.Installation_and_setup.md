# Installation and setup new project

If you go to main React-native site, you can see these steps below to setup:
### Requirements

    OS X - This repo only contains the iOS implementation right now, and Xcode only runs on Mac.
    New to Xcode? Download it from the Mac App Store.
    Homebrew is the recommended way to install node, watchman, and flow.
    brew install node. 
    brew install --HEAD watchman. We recommend installing watchman, otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug.
    brew install flow. If you want to use flow.

### Quick start

    npm install -g react-native-cli
    react-native init AwesomeProject

In the newly created folder AwesomeProject/

    Open AwesomeProject.xcodeproj and hit run in Xcode
    Open index.ios.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines
    Hit cmd+R (twice) in your iOS simulator to reload the app and see your change!

Congratulations! You've just successfully run and modified your first React Native app.

### Troubleshooting

In case your Xcode built failed. Please follow steps below:

- Clone main react native repository from github:
    `git clone https://github.com/facebook/react-native`
- Copy Examples/SampleApp to Examples/AwesomeProject
    `mkdir Examples/AwesomeProject`
    `cp -R Examples/SampleApp Examples/AwesomeProject`
- Run packager.sh to point to AwesomeProject just created:
    `packager/packager.sh --root=./Examples/AwesomeProject`
- Now reopen again AwesomeProject in Xcode and start building.

### Build and run on device:

- In order to build and run on your device, follow these steps below:
    `curl http://localhost:8081/index.ios.js > main.jsbundle`
    
    **In Xcode, click on Project name, goto Build Phases, and link the main.jsbundle to Assets**

    **Open* AppDelegate.m*, remove the default code, and edit as below:**
    
     `NSURL *jsCodeLocation;`
    `jsCodeLocation = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];`
    `RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBundleURL:jsCodeLocation moduleName:@"SampleApp" launchOptions:self.launchOptions];`
    
- Now try to build and run project on your device.


## So what is React-Native ?

Phuhh. Congratulation if you come to this step. I hope you're seeing your AwesomeProject running on your iPhone 5. Now it's time to understand what's going on.

In traditional iOS architecture, if you're an artist, you have:

- A `Canvas`, it's the `UIWindow` class you often use to create your window application.
- A `Brush`, it's the `UIViewController` that you use to draw something on `Canvas`
- A `Paint`, it's the color and the view for your application. You use it with a `Brush`, and paint on a `Canvas`.

For more complex application design, you will have many `Brush`, as well as `Paint`.  They're nested to others in a top-down manner to compose GUI.

`React-Native` is just a `Paint`. If you see in the code above:

    NSURL *jsCodeLocation;
    jsCodeLocation = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];
    RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBundleURL:jsCodeLocation moduleName:@"SampleApp" launchOptions:self.launchOptions];
    
you will see that to create new `React-Native` view, you have to pass two parameters:
- The `jsLocation` address: it's the local or remote url for the `React component`.
- The module name: It's the name that you register with `AppRegistry` in `index.ios.js` file:

    `AppRegistry.registerComponent('SampleApp', () => SampleApp);`
    
After creating the `React-Native View`, now you can use its properties like any other `iOS View`, it's the `Paint` of your project. 

### Exercise:

It's enough for theory. There is a small exercise for you before you come to chapter 2.

    Create new react native view, and put it inside a `ViewController`, style the view with backgroundColor blue.
    
### Solution:

Please do the exercise by yourself before coming here!
If you're completely new to iOS, i recommend you to learn some basic Objective-C. There is a [good resource](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/objective-c/) here for you to learn.

Now create two file `MyViewController.h` and `MyViewController.m` in xcode. The code for each file is listed below:

    // MyViewController.h
    #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    #import "RCTRootView.h"
    @interface MyViewController : UIViewController
    @property (weak, nonatomic) NSDictionary *launchOptions;
    @end
    
    // MyViewController.m
    #import "MyViewController.h"

    @implementation MyViewController
    - (void)viewDidLoad
    {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        NSURL *jsCodeLocation;
        jsCodeLocation = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];
        
        RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBundleURL:jsCodeLocation moduleName:@"AdmobTest" launchOptions:self.launchOptions];
        rootView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 50, viewRect.size.width, viewRect.size.height - 50);
        [self.view addSubview:rootView];
    }
    @end
