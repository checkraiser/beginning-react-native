# Installation and setup new project

If you go to main React-native site, you can see these steps below to setup:
### Requirements

    OS X - This repo only contains the iOS implementation right now, and Xcode only runs on Mac.
    New to Xcode? Download it from the Mac App Store.
    Homebrew is the recommended way to install node, watchman, and flow.
    brew install node. 
    brew install --HEAD watchman. We recommend installing watchman, otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug.
    brew install flow. If you want to use flow.

### Quick start

    npm install -g react-native-cli
    react-native init AwesomeProject
    cd AwesomeProject
    

In the newly created folder AwesomeProject/

    Open AwesomeProject.xcodeproj and hit run in Xcode
    Open index.ios.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines
    Hit cmd+R (twice) in your iOS simulator to reload the app and see your change!

Congratulations! You've just successfully run and modified your first React Native app.

### A closer look at application creation
Let's look what's inside the AwesomeProject/ just created:

    AwesomeProject.xcodeproj/
    iOS/
    index.ios.js
    node_modules/
    package.json

To give you the full picture, here is what exactly happens when running `react-native init AwesomeProject`:

- A folder named AwesomeProject is created
- In it, the package.json file is created
- npm install --save react-native is run, which installs react-native and its dependencies into AwesomeProject/node_modules and declares react-native as a dependency of your project in AwesomeProject/package.json
- The globally installed react-native CLI tool then hands over control to the local CLI tool that has just been installed into AwesomeProject/node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js
- This in turn executes AwesomeProject/node_modules/react-native/init.sh, which is yet another helper script that takes care of putting the boiler plate application code in place, like the
minimal React Native code in file index.ios.js and the Objective-C code plus other goodies
in subfolder iOS, and the Xcode® project definition in subfolder AwesomeProject.xcodeproj

We already saw that the React Native based JavaScript code that makes up our actual application lives in `index.ios.js`.

The `package.json` file is no surprise for those who already worked with Node.js; it defines some metadata for our project and, most importantly, declares react-native (this time, the real thing, i.e.,
the actual framework that makes our application possible) as a dependency of our own project.

The `node_modules` folder is simply a result of the npm install run that took place during project
initialization. It contains the react-native code, which in turn consists of other NPM dependencies,
helper scripts, and a lot of JavaScript and Objective-C code.

The initialization process also provided the minimum Xcode project definitions plus some Objective-C boilerplate code, which allows us to open our new project in Xcode and to instantly run the application without any further ado. All of this could have been done manually, but would include a lot of steps that are identical no matter what kind of application we are going to write, thus it makes sense to streamline this process via react-native init.

To integrate thirth-party libraries into ReactNative project, please add the file Podfile under root folder.

`Podfile` is similar to `package.json`; it declares Objective-C library dependencies for the CocoaPods
dependency manager. We will talk about this in more detail later in the book, and ignore it for
now.

The takeaway here is that our AwesomeProject project is multiple things at once. It is an Xcode® project,
but it’s also an NPM project. It’s a React Native based JavaScript application, but it also contains
some iOS glue code that is needed to make our JavaScript code run on iOS in the first place.

### Troubleshooting

- Install React Native Using CocoaPods

There are three use cases when you consider using `CocoaPods` in your projects
    - You want to integrate third-party libraries (that use `CocoaPods`) into your newly created ReactNative project.
    - Your project currently uses `CocoaPods` to manage dependencies and libraries.
    - You want to add to existing project the `ReactNative` framework.

`CocoaPods` is a package management tool for iOS/Mac development. We need to use it to download React Native. If you haven't install `CocoaPods` yet, Run this command to install.

    gem install cocoapods
    
You will need to install `Ruby` to use the `gem` command

When you are ready to work with `CocoaPods`, add the following line to Podfile. If you don't have one, then create it under the root directory of your project.

    pod 'React'
    pod 'React/RCTText'

Add any subspecs you want to use in your project

Remember to install all subspecs you need. The <Text> element cannot be used without `pod 'React/RCTText'`.

Then install your pods:

    $ pod install
    
- Suppose you puts all `javascript` file under folder `ReactComponent`, and you use the `require` to import javascript module to use, consider add the file `package.json` under folder `ReactComponent`:

    *package.json*
    {
        "name": "my project",
        "version": "1.0.0"
    }
- Start Development Server

In root directory, we need to start React Native development server.

    (JS_DIR=`pwd`/ReactComponent; cd Pods/React; npm run start -- --root $JS_DIR)

This command will start up a React Native development server within our `CocoaPods` dependency to build our bundled script. The `--root` option indicates the root of your React Native apps – this will be our `ReactComponents` directory containing the single `index.ios.js` file. This running server will package up the index.ios.bundle file accessible via `http://localhost:8081/index.ios.bundle`

Then you can use the `require` function to import javascript modules.


In case your Xcode built failed. Please follow steps below:

- Clone main react native repository from github:
    `git clone https://github.com/facebook/react-native`
- Copy Examples/SampleApp to Examples/AwesomeProject
    `mkdir Examples/AwesomeProject`
    `cp -R Examples/SampleApp/* Examples/AwesomeProject`
- Run packager.sh to point to AwesomeProject just created:
    `packager/packager.sh --root=./Examples/AwesomeProject`
- Now reopen again AwesomeProject in Xcode and start building.

### Build and run on device:

- In order to build and run on your device, follow these steps below:
    `curl http://localhost:8081/index.ios.js > main.jsbundle`
    
    **In Xcode, click on Project name, goto Build Phases, and link the main.jsbundle to Assets**

    **Open* AppDelegate.m*, remove the default code, and edit as below:**
    
     `NSURL *jsCodeLocation;`
    `jsCodeLocation = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];`
    `RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBundleURL:jsCodeLocation moduleName:@"SampleApp" launchOptions:self.launchOptions];`
    
- Now try to build and run project on your device.


## So what is React-Native ?

Phuhh. Congratulation if you come to this step. I hope you're seeing your AwesomeProject running on your iPhone 5. Now it's time to understand what's going on.

In traditional iOS architecture, if you're an artist, you have:

- A `Canvas`, it's the `UIWindow` class you often use to create your window application.
- A `Brush`, it's the `UIViewController` that you use to draw something on `Canvas`
- A `Paint`, it's the color and the view for your application. You use it with a `Brush`, and paint on a `Canvas`.

For more complex application design, you will have many `Brush`, as well as `Paint`.  They're nested to others in a top-down manner to compose GUI.

![ios](http://i.gyazo.com/9e2a96eb7b9c339204deaa150d650177.png)

Example:

    // Creating the Canvas
    self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds]; 
    // Creating the Brush
    MyViewController  *rootViewController = [[MyViewController alloc] init];
    rootViewController.launchOptions = launchOptions;
    // Make the Canvas use the Brush
    self.window.rootViewController = rootViewController;
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    return YES;
You create `Canvas` with `Frame`, then create the `Brush`, link it to the `Canvas` to make it the `rootViewController`.
Inside the `Brush`, now you can create `Paint`, it's the `subView` of the `Brush`:

    RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBundleURL:jsCodeLocation moduleName:@"AdmobTest" launchOptions:self.launchOptions];
    rootView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 50, viewRect.size.width, viewRect.size.height - 50);
    [self.view addSubview:rootView];

You can add as many `subView`  as you want.
Sweet!

So `React-Native` is just a `Paint`. If you see in the code below:

    NSURL *jsCodeLocation;
    jsCodeLocation = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];
    RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBundleURL:jsCodeLocation moduleName:@"SampleApp" launchOptions:self.launchOptions];
    
you will see that to create new `React-Native` view, you have to pass two parameters:
- The `jsLocation` address: it's the local or remote url for the `React component`.
- The module name: It's the name that you register with `AppRegistry` in `index.ios.js` file:

    `AppRegistry.registerComponent('SampleApp', () => SampleApp);`
    
After creating the `React-Native View`, now you can use its properties like any other `iOS View`, it's the `Paint` of your project. 

### Exercise:

It's enough for theory. There is a small exercise for you before you come to chapter 2.

    Create new react native view, and put it inside a `ViewController`, style the view with backgroundColor blue.
    
### Solution:

Please do the exercise by yourself before coming here!
If you're completely new to iOS, i recommend you to learn some basic Objective-C. There is a [good resource](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/objective-c/) here for you to learn.

Now create two file `MyViewController.h` and `MyViewController.m` in xcode. The code for each file is listed below:

    // MyViewController.h
    #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    #import "RCTRootView.h"
    @interface MyViewController : UIViewController
    @property (weak, nonatomic) NSDictionary *launchOptions;
    @end
    
    // MyViewController.m
    #import "MyViewController.h"

    @implementation MyViewController
    - (void)viewDidLoad
    {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        NSURL *jsCodeLocation;
        jsCodeLocation = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];
        
        RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBundleURL:jsCodeLocation moduleName:@"AdmobTest" launchOptions:self.launchOptions];
        rootView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 50, viewRect.size.width, viewRect.size.height - 50);
        [self.view addSubview:rootView];
    }
    @end
    
Now modify the default `SampleApp's AppDelegate.m`:

    #import "AppDelegate.h"
    #import "MyViewController.h"
    @implementation AppDelegate
    
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    {
      //NSURL *jsCodeLocation;
    
      // Loading JavaScript code - uncomment the one you want.
    
      // OPTION 1
      // Load from development server. Start the server from the repository root:
      //
      // $ npm start
      //
      // To run on device, change `localhost` to the IP address of your computer, and make sure your computer and
      // iOS device are on the same Wi-Fi network.
      //jsCodeLocation = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://localhost:8081/index.ios.bundle"];
    
      // OPTION 2
      // Load from pre-bundled file on disk. To re-generate the static bundle, run
      //
      // $ curl http://localhost:8081/index.ios.bundle -o main.jsbundle
      //
      // and uncomment the next following line
        
        
        self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds];
        //UIViewController *rootViewController = [[UIViewController alloc] init];
        MyViewController  *rootViewController = [[MyViewController alloc] init];
        rootViewController.launchOptions = launchOptions;
        self.window.rootViewController = rootViewController;
        [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
        return YES;
    }
    
    @end
    
You'll see i comment out all default `SampleApp` code, and put in our new MyViewController created above.
Try to build and run project again. You will understand what's React Native View is about.
We're ready to go to next step: Adding Flexbox layout.
